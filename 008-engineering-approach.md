# Selecting engineering approach for project

## Context and Problem Statement

We are undertaking a project that involves developing a software product expected to evolve over time due to changing requirements, constraints, and feedback. An appropriate engineering approach needs to be selected to manage development effectively and adaptively.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for flexibility in response to changing requirements.
* Importance of frequent feedback and engagement.
* Requirement to deliver value continuously and incrementally.
* Necessity to quickly adapt to external factors affecting the project.

## Considered Options

* Agile methodology
* Waterfall methodology
* Spiral methodology

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Agile methodology", because it provides the necessary framework to accommodate frequent changes, encourages 'stakeholder' involvement, and focuses on 

### Consequences

* Good because, highly adaptable to changes in project scope or requirements.
* Good because, it encourages frequent communication and collaboration, enhancing team synergy and stakeholder satisfaction.
* Good because, it delivers working software quickly and iteratively, providing ongoing value to stakeholders.
* Bad because, it can be challenging in environments with rigid schedules or where upfront extensive documentation is required.
* Bad because, may lead to scope creep if not managed properly due to the iterative nature of requirement gathering.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Agile

* Good because, highly adaptable to changes in project scope or requirements.
* Good because, it encourages frequent communication and collaboration, enhancing team synergy and stakeholder satisfaction.
* Good because, it delivers working software quickly and iteratively, providing ongoing value to stakeholders.
* Bad because, it can be challenging in environments with rigid schedules or where upfront extensive documentation is required.
* Bad because, may lead to scope creep if not managed properly due to the iterative nature of requirement gathering.

### Waterfall

* Good because, simple and straightforward linear approach, which can be easier to manage and measure.
* Good because, emphasizes thorough documentation and upfront planning, beneficial in highly regulated environments.
* Bad because, inflexible to changes; any modifications in later stages can be costly and time-consuming.
* Bad because, delays in delivering a working product until late in the project lifecycle, which can hinder feedback incorporation.

### Spiral

* Good because, it focuses on risk assessment, making it suitable for large and complex projects with significant risks.
* Good because, it combines elements of both design and prototyping in stages, allowing for iterative enhancements.
* Bad because, it can be more complex to manage due to its iterative risk analysis and multiple development cycles.
* Bad because, it is often more time-consuming, making it less ideal for smaller or less risk-averse projects.
