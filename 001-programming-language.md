# Deciding what programming language to use

## Context and Problem Statement

We must select a programming language which we will develop our project in. This will impact the development approach to this project and what code libaries, resources, etc will be avaiable to us.

## Decision Drivers

* Libraries that support AI model development
* Able to work with a web based application

## Considered Options

* Python
* R
* Java

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Python", because it has multiple code libraries (Tensorflow, Pytourch) that support model development, multiple web based frameworks (Django, Flask, Python Plotly Dash) which allow for flexability during development. It is also the langauge that we are most knowledgeable with so the learning gap is much lower than alternate options.

### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Python

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}

### R

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}

### Java

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}
