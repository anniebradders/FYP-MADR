# Deciding what programming language to use

## Context and Problem Statement

We must select a programming language which we will develop our project in. This will impact the development approach to this project and what code libaries, resources, etc will be avaiable to us.

## Decision Drivers

* Libraries that support AI model development
* Able to work with a web based application

## Considered Options

* Python
* R
* Java

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Python", because it has multiple code libraries (Tensorflow, Pytourch) that support model development, multiple web based frameworks (Django, Flask, Python Plotly Dash) which allow for flexability during development. It is also the langauge that we are most knowledgeable with so the learning gap is much lower than alternate options.

### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Python

* Good, because Python has a large amount of libaries that are reliable
* Good, because already familar with Python code base
* Bad, because Python can be relatively slow

### R

* Good, for statistics and data analysis, with a strong set of packages for linear modeling, time-series analysis, and data visualization.
* Bad, less efficient for real-time applications.
* Neutral learning gap would be greater as not familar with the language.

### Java

* Good, because robust web development frameworks available
* Bad, it lacks the simplicity and the extensive machine learning library support found in Python.
